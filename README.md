ProteinEvolver generates samples of protein sequences evolved along phylogenies under empirical and structurally constrained substitution models of protein evolution. 

The version 1.2.0 provides the simulation of molecular evolution along phylogenetic histories, which can be either user-specified or simulated by the coalescent modified with recombination (including recombination hotspots), migration, demographics and longitudinal sampling.

The version 2.2.0 provides the additional simulation of protein evolution combining the evolutionary history given by a birth-death population genetics process with the structurally constrained substitution models of protein evolution. In particular, the fitness of every simulated protein variant is calculated and used to determine its birth and death rates of its evolution.
