ProteinEvolver generates samples of protein sequences evolved along phylogenies under empirical and structurally constrained substitution models of protein evolution. 
In ProteinEvolver1.2.0, The simulation of molecular evolution occurs along phylogenetic histories, which can be either user-specified or simulated by the coalescent modified with recombination (including recombination hotspots), migration, demographics and longitudinal sampling.

To download ProteinEvolver I recommend use the Chrome browser. Then go to releases and click on the desired files (ProteinEvolver-1.2.0.zip; do not download Source code files because they only include a readme).
